// Only the TV client ever lists dubs here: the anonymous clients returns the original
// track alone, so `allDashAudioFormats` stays empty and the picker stays off.

// On SABR a track change is a format change — the session re-opens with the
// chosen audio format in `preferred_audio_format_ids`, which is exactly what a
// quality switch does for video, so it goes through the same build path.
